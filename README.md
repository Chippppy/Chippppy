## 💻 What I'm Working On

I enjoy diving into projects that span different domains:

- **Security & Backend**: I like knowing how to break things (and how to stop others breaking things).
- **Web Development**: Web-tech satisfies both my problem-solving, logical itch while also allowing for personal design  
- **Gaming Tools**: Exploring the intersection of gaming and programming
- **CLI Tools**: I enjoy making small CLI based tools that improve unique tasks, such as downloading my music library, etc.
- **Commercial Internal Tools**: I work building private commercial tools for internal use including responsive interactive big data dashboards, project management plug-ins and automations, alongside custom ecommerce solutions, and more.
